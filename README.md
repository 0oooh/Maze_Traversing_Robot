# Maze_Traversing_Robot
This project controls a robot that traverses a maze, performs a 720-degree turn, and returns along its path. The robot uses infrared (IR) sensors to detect the maze and completes the mission by navigating the maze, rotating 720 degrees, and retracing its steps before stopping at the end.
